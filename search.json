Bootstrapping one solution problem require assumptions valid nonparametric inference; however, computationally intensive since original model needs fit many times, problems model apparent bootstrap samples (e.g., failure converge, perfect prediction) can make using bootstrapping challenging. Simulation-based inference provides compromise two methods: accurate delta method require assumptions 2) 3), faster stable bootstrapping model needs fit . Simulation-based inference involves simulating model coefficients multivariate distribution using estimated values covariance single model fit original data, computing quantities interest set model coefficients, performing inference using resulting distribution estimates sampling distribution. Confidence intervals can computed using percentiles resulting sampling distribution, p-values can computed inverting confidence intervals. Alternatively, resulting sampling distribution normally distributed, standard error can estimated standard deviation estimates normal-theory confidence intervals p-values can computed. clarify package designed provide simple, general interface simulation-based inference, along convenience functions perform common tasks like computing average marginal effects. primary functions clarify sim(), sim_apply(), summary(), plot(). work together create simple workflow simulation-based inference. sim() simulates model parameters fitted model sim_apply() applies estimator simulated coefficients, original object new coefficients inserted summary() produces confidence intervals p-values resulting estimates plot() produces plots simulated sampling distribution resulting estimates also wrappers sim_apply() performing common operations: sim_ame() computes average marginal effect variable, mirroring marginaleffects::comparisons() marginaleffects::marginaleffects(); sim_setx() computes predicted values typical values covariates differences , mirroring Zelig::setx() Zelig::setx1().","code":""},{"path":"https://ngreifer.github.io/clarify/index.html","id":"example","dir":"","previous_headings":"","what":"Example","title":"Simulation-Based Inference for Regression Models","text":"example performing g-computation ATT logistic regression compute marginal log risk ratio confidence interval:  clarify provides shortcut computing average marginal effects comparisons average adjusted predictions, sim_ame(), essentially wrapper sim_apply() extra processing. can compute log marginal risk ratio : used marginaleffects, uses delta method instead: plot simulated sampling distribution indicates sampling distribution log risk ratio normally distributed around estimate, indicating delta method may poor approximation asymmetric confidence intervals produced using simulation may valid. want compute marginal risk ratio, can using transform() already-produced output: can also use clarify compute predictions first differences set typical values predictors, mimicking functionality Zelig’s setx() setx1() functions, using sim_setx():  clarify offers parallel processing estimation functions speed computation. methodology simulation-based inference described King, Tomz, Wittenberg (2000).
