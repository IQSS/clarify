Thank you for considering our article "`clarify`: Simulation-Based Inference for Regression Models" for publication in the R Journal. The article describes the use of our package `clarify` for performing simulation-based inference of post-estimation quantities from regression, which enhances the interpretation of these models without making the same assumptions and approximations similar methods make. We believe this will be useful to anyone performing statistical analysis with regression and therefore will have broad appeal to R users. Please feel free to reach out with any questions or additional materials that might be useful.
