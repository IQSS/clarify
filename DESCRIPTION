Description: Performs simulation-based inference as an alternative to the delta method for obtaining valid confidence intervals and p-values, which is especially useful when the resulting quantity is not normally distributed and the delta method approximation fails. The framework for simulation-based inference is described in King, Tomz, and Wittenberg (2000) <doi:10.2307/2669316>.
